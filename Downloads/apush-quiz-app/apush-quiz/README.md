### Reason for Creation
Wanted to see if I could learn a new programming language in a week and build something that I was proud of

### Development Timeline
Started as APUSH Fluency Facts - 120 terms needed to learn, took about 1-2 weeks to fully learn JS + learn how to code well enough
- became a website (vercel app) so i could share the online flashcards (quizlet was being annoying to use)  --- hit 100 total views on 9/1 ish
- added AP World and AP Euro terms so could reach more people
- added more tracking so I can get more insight on what ppl use + also learned more about what people wanted
- added flashcards based on user requests!
- added shuffle based on user requests!
- learned how to check console logs finally
- hit 400 total views on 9/14



### How to Commit and make vercel happy
git add .
git commit -m "mesage"
git push  - breaks vercel a tad so gotta repush it only to vercel
vercel --prod
